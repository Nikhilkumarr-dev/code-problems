# Code Problems - DSA Practice

Welcome to **Code Problems**, a collection of solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems implemented in multiple languages like **Java** and **TypeScript**.  
This repository is focused on **learning, practicing, and mastering core DSA concepts** through clean and well-structured code.

##  Topics Covered

###  Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

###  Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  

###  Tree Data Structures
- Generic Trees and Traversals  

###  TypeScript Practice
- Basic problem-solving and algorithmic exercises

## Goal of This Repository

The main aim is to:
- Strengthen problem-solving and logic-building skills  
- Develop an understanding of **time and space complexity**  
- Prepare for **technical interviews** and **competitive programming**  
- Practice clean code and modular programming principles

##  Future Plans

- Add more algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Tree, Graphs, etc.)
- Include complexity analysis for each problem  
- Add Python and C++ implementations  
- Provide explanations for each algorithm in markdown files
